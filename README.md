This is a simple chat and monitoring bot.

Requirements:
  * See requirements.txt

This bot is only tested on Linux.

To start the bot, create a file named `.env` that has the bot token (the file should look like `TOKEN=...`) and the default model to use (`DEFAULT_MODEL="llama3"` ...) and run `python thebot.py`.

This bot currently only supports getting data from Nvidia GPUs.

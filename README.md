This is a simple chat and monitoring bot.

Requirements:

* [ollama-python](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python) (and [Ollama](https://ollama.com))
* [Pycord](https://pycord.dev/)

This bot is only tested on Linux.

To start the bot, create a file named `.env` that has the bot token (the file should look like `TOKEN=...`).
